# DevOps-Tooling-Website-Solution
n previous project [Implementing Web Solution https://github.com/Divinepj/Implementing-Wordpress-Web-Solution] I implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further I will add some more value to my solution so that a member of a DevOps team could utilize.

In this project,, I will be introducing the concept of file sharing for multiple servers to share the same web content and also a database for storing data related to the website using **RHEL-8.6.0_HVM-20220503-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2**

## STEP 1 Preparing NFS Server
Create an EC2 instance (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 on AWS) on which we will setup our NFS(Network File Storage) Server.

On this server we attach 2 EBS volumes 10GB each as external storage to our instance and create 3 logical volumes on it through which we will attach mounts from our external web servers.

-   3 logical volumes lv-opt, lv-apps and lv-logs
-   3 mount directory /mnt/opt, /mnt/apps and /mnt/logs
-   Webserver content will be stores in /apps, webserver logs in /logs and /opt will be used by Jenkins

We first create the logigal volumes and `xfs` file systems as shown below
![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-29-56.png) and ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-27-31.png)

we therefore proceed to create directories `/mnt/apps`, `/mnt/opt`, and `/mnt/logs`
![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-34-15.png)
we then mount this on the logical volumes as shown below ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-37-02.png)

we then proceed to install the NFS server by running the following commands 
```
{
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install nfs-utils -y
sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
}
```

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-46-40.png)

we then make sure that the the permissions that will allow our web servers to read, write and execute file on NFS by running the commands below 
```
{
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/apps
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/logs
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/opt

sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/apps
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/logs
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/opt

sudo systemctl restart nfs-server.service
}
```

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_18-52-31.png)

we then configure access to NFS for clients within the same subnet CIDR. we get the subnet cidr on the AWS web console as by running the command below `sudo vi /etc/exports` shown below 
![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-02-28.png)
we add the following to the configuration file as shown below
```
{
/mnt/apps <Subnet-CIDR>(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
/mnt/logs <Subnet-CIDR>(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
/mnt/opt <Subnet-CIDR>(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
}
```

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-03-52.png)

and `sudo exportfs -arv` as shown below ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-05-05.png)

we then check the which port is used by NFS and open it using security groups by running the commands ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-05-55.png)

## Preparing Database Server

Create an Redhat Server on AWS which will serve as our Database. Ensure its in the same subnet as the NFS-Server.

we then proceed to Install mysql-server by running the commands below 
```
{
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt install -y mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl status mysql
}
```
![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-18-06.png)

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-19-49.png)

We then create a database and name it tooling, create a database user and name it webaccess and grant permission to webaccess user on tooling database to do anything only from the webservers subnet cidr by running the commands 
```
{
sudo mysql
CREATE DATABASE tooling;
CREATE USER `webaccess`@`<subnet cidr>` IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
GRANT ALL ON tooling.* TO 'webaccess'@'<subnet cidr>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SHOW DATABASES;
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
}
```
as shown below ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-47-18.png)

## Preparing Web Servers

Create a RHEL EC2 instance on AWS which serves as our web server. Also remember to have in it in same subnet

A couple of configurations will be done on the web servers:

- configuring NFS client
- deploying tooling website application
- configure servers to work with database
Installing NFS-Client

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-53-48.png)

We will then connect our `/var/www` directory to our webserver with the `/mnt/apps` on nfs server. This is acheived by mounting the NFS server directory to the webserver directory by running ``sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nosuid <NFS private IP>:/mnt/logs /var/log/httpd` as shown below

![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-56-31.png)
 

We then ensure that our mounts remain intact when the server reboots. This is achieved by configuring the fstab directory by running the `sudo vi /etc/fstab` 
add the following line <NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address>:/mnt/apps /var/www nfs defaults 0 0 as shown below ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_19-57-55.png)

## Installing Apache and Php
we then run the following commands to install both Apache and PHP 
```
{
sudo yum install httpd -y

sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

sudo dnf module reset php

sudo dnf module enable php:remi-7.4

sudo dnf install php php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd

sudo systemctl start php-fpm

sudo systemctl enable php-fpm

setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1
}
```
We can see that both /var/www and /mnt/apps contains same content. This shows that both mount points are connected via NFS. ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_20-09-57.png)
 and 
 ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_20-10-21.png)

We locate the log folder for Apache on the Web Server and mount it to NFS serverâ€™s export for logs. Make sure the mount point will persist after reboot by running and `sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nosuid <NFS private IP>:/mnt/logs /var/log/httpd` as shown below
![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-22_22-31-23.png)

On the NFS Server, add web content into the /mnt/apps directory. This should contain a html folder. The same content will be present in the /var/www directory in the web server. ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_20-55-36.png)

Run <public_ip_address>/index.php on a web browser to access the site. Use public_ip_address of the web server. TCP port 80 should be open on the web broswer as shown below ![alt text](./IMG/Snipaste_2023-11-09_20-57-04.png)

In the /var/www/html directory , edit the already written php script to connect to the database `sudo vi /var/www/html/functions.php` ![alt text]()

After the modification , connect to the database server from the web server by running `mysql -h <databse-private-ip> -u <db-username> -p <db-pasword> < tooling-db.sql` as shown below ![alt text]()
